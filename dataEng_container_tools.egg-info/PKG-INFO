Description: # Data Engineering Container Tools
        
        This packages is split into three parts: **CLA**, **GCS**, and **safe_stdout**.
        
        ## CLA:
        Deals with receiving input from the command line. Has three classes: `custom_command_line_argument`, `command_line_argument_type`, and `command_line_arguments`.
        
        * `custom_command_line_arguments`: Acts as a container for custom command line arguments. All of the attributes available when creating command line arguments through [the `parser.add_argument()` method](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#argparse.ArgumentParser.add_argument) from [the `argparse` library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) are available in this class. Has the following methods:
          * `__init__`: Creates the class with the following inputs:
            * `name`: Required. The name of the command line argument. Should be given without the preceding '--', which will be added automatically.
            * `action`: Optional. Defaults to `None`. The basic type of action to be taken when this argument is encountered at the command line.
            * `nargs`: Optional. Defaults to `None`. The number of command-line arguments that should be consumed. A number, `'*'`, or `'+'`.
            * `const`: Optional. Defaults to `None`. A constant value required by some action and nargs selections.
            * `default`: Optional. Defaults to `None`. The value produced if the argument is absent from the command line.
            * `data_type`: Optional. Defaults to `None`. The type to which the command-line argument should be converted.
            * `choices`: Optional. Defaults to `None`. A container of the allowable values for the argument.
            * `required`: Optional. Defaults to `None`. Whether or not the command-line option may be omitted (optionals only).
            * `help_message`: Optional. Defaults to `None`. A brief description of what the argument does.
            * `metavar`: Optional. Defaults to `None`. A name for the argument in usage messages.
            * `dest`: Optional. Defaults to `None`. The name of the attribute to be added to the object returned by parse_args().
            
        * `command_line_argument_type`: Enumeration type. Used for populating initialization fields in `command_line_arguments`. Has the following types:
          * `OPTIONAL`: Indicates the associated command line argument should be created as optional.
          * `REQUIRED`: Indicates the associated command line argument should be created as required.
          
        * `command_line_arguments`: Creates and parses command line arguments. Includes helper functions for using the command line inputs. Has the following methods:
          * `__init__`: Created the class with the following inputs:
            * `input_files`: Optional `command_line_argument_type`. Defaults to `None`. If `REQUIRED`, will add `--input_bucket_names`, `--input_paths`, and `--input_filenames` as required command line inputs. If `OPTIONAL`, will add them as optional. If `None` they will not be added.
            * `output_files`: Optional `command_line_argument_type`. Defaults to `None`. If `REQUIRED`, will add `--output_bucket_names`, `--output_paths`, and `--output_filenames` as required command line inputs. If `command_line_argument_type.OPTIONAL`, will add them as optional. If `None` they will not be added.
            * `secret_locations`: Optional `command_line_argument_type`. Defaults to `None`. If `REQUIRED`, will add `--gcs_secret_locations` as required command line input. If `OPTIONAL`, will add it as optional. If `None`, it will not be added.
            * `default_file_type`: Optional `command_line_argument_type`. Defaults to `None`. If `REQUIRED`, will add `--default_file_type` as required command line argument. If `OPTIONAL`, will add it as optional. Input can be one of `parquet`, `csv`, `pkl`, or `json`, with the default being `parquet`. If `None`, the command line argument will not be added. 
            * `custom_inputs`: Optional list of `custom_command_line_arguments`. Defaults to `None`. All items in list will be added to the command line arguments.
            * `description` : Optional `string`. Defaults to `None`. A description to be printed when the command line argument `--help` is used.
            * `input_dtypes`: Optional `command_line_argument_type`. Defaults to `None`. If `input_files` is `None`, then this does nothing. If `input_files` is not `None` and `input_dtypes` is `REQUIRED`, will add `--input_dtypes`as a required command line input. If `OPTIONAL`, will add it as optional.  Input is a JSON dictionary of (column: type) pairs.
            * `parser`: Optional `argparse.ArgumentParser`. Defaults to `None`. A parser on which to add the command line arguments and parse. If `None` one will be created.
            * `running_local`: Optional `argparse.ArgumentParser`. Defaults to `None`. A flag for determining whether or not the script is running locally. Defaults to False.
          * `get_arguments`: Returns the arguments passed in through the command line as a `Namespace` object.
          * `get_input_dtypes`: Returns the input dtypes passed in through the command line.
          * `get_input_uris`: Returns the input_uris passed in through the command line as a list of strings. All of the format `gs://[BUCKETNAME]/[FILEPATH]/[FILENAME]`. If one bucket is specified, the same bucket is used for every file path. If more than one bucket is specified, one bucket is used for one file path, and there must be a 1:1:1 ratio of buckets to filepaths, to file names.
          * `get_output_uris`: Returns the output_uris passed in through the command line as a list of strings. All of the format `gs://[BUCKETNAME]/[FILEPATH]/[FILENAME]`. If one bucket is specified, the same bucket is used for every file path. If more than one bucket is specified, one bucket is used for one file path, and there must be a 1:1:1 ratio of buckets to filepaths, to file names.
          * `get_secret_locations`: Returns the secret locations passed in through the command line as a list of strings.
          * `check_args`: Does nothing. In future this will error check the arguments passed in through the command line.
          
        ## GCS:

        ## Example:
        An example workflow might look something like this:
        ```
        from dataEng_container_tools.cla import command_line_arguments, command_line_argument_type
        from dataEng_container_tools.gcs import gcs_file_io
        
        my_inputs = command_line_arguments(secret_locations=command_line_argument_type.OPTIONAL,
                                           input_files=command_line_argument_type.REQUIRED,
                                           output_files=command_line_argument_type.REQUIRED)
        
        input_uris = my_inputs.get_input_uris()
        output_uris = my_inputs.get_output_uris()
        secret_locations = my_inputs.get_secret_locations()                              
        file_io = gcs_file_io(gcs_secret_location = secret_locations[0])
        pqt_obj = file_io.download_file_to_object(input_uris[0])
        #
        # Edit the object in some way here.
        #
        result = file_io.upload_file_from_object(gcs_uri=output_uris[0], object_to_upload=pqt_obj)
        ```
